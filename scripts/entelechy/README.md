# Entelechy Framework Scripts

This directory contains scripts for the Entelechy vital actualization framework - tools for managing developmental markers and system coherence.

## Core Scripts

### entelechy_cli.py
Command-line interface for interacting with the Entelechy framework.

### entelechy_introspection.py
Deep introspection and analysis of system state and markers.

### entelechy_marker_analyzer.py
Analyze markers (TODO, FIXME, PLACEHOLDER) across the codebase.

### entelechy_marker_prioritizer.py
Prioritize markers based on impact, effort, and dependencies.

### entelechy_marker_resolver.py
Automated resolution of markers with appropriate implementations.

### demonstrate_entelechy.py
Demonstration of Entelechy framework capabilities.

## Concepts

The Entelechy framework implements a systematic approach to actualizing potential in the cognitive architecture:

- **Markers**: Developmental indicators (TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER/STUB)
- **Fragmentation**: Architectural inconsistencies requiring resolution
- **Actualization**: Process of realizing potential implementations
- **Coherence**: Maintaining system integrity during evolution

## Usage

Run these scripts from the repository root. They work together to provide a comprehensive system for managing codebase evolution and marker resolution.

See `docs/entelechy/` for detailed documentation on the Entelechy framework.
