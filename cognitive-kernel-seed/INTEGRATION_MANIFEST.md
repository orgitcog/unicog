# Cognitive Kernel Seed Integration Manifest

## Overview

This manifest describes the integration of the cognitive kernel seed with the OpenCog Unified foundation layer (cogutil and atomspace).

## Components

### 1. Meta-System Loops

Three levels of meta-cognition implemented as Scheme scripts:

- **Level 0 (Object)**: Direct cognitive processing
  - File: `loops/level0_object_processing.scm`
  - Operations: perceive, reason, act
  
- **Level 1 (Meta)**: Monitoring and adaptation
  - File: `loops/level1_meta_monitoring.scm`
  - Operations: monitor, evaluate, adapt
  
- **Level 2 (Meta-Meta)**: Introspection and evolution
  - File: `loops/level2_introspection.scm`
  - Operations: introspect, improve, evolve

### 2. Autognosis Initialization

Bootstrap self-awareness through recursive self-reference:

- File: `loops/autognosis_init.scm`
- Features:
  - Recursive self-reference chains
  - Self-modification capability
  - Emergent awareness markers

### 3. Self-Image Building

Dynamic self-model construction:

- File: `introspection/self_image_builder.scm`
- Aspects:
  - Structural self (components)
  - Functional self (capabilities)
  - Performance self (metrics)
  - Goal-oriented self (objectives)

## Integration Points

### Foundation Layer

1. **CogUtil Integration**
   - Tensor Shape: [64, 32, 16]
   - DOF: 32,768
   - Role: Computational substrate for meta-loops

2. **AtomSpace Integration**
   - Tensor Shape: [1024, 512, 256]
   - DOF: 134,217,728
   - Role: Knowledge base for self-model

### GGML Kernel Adaptation

Meta-system loops are parameterized as tensor operations:
- Loop states as tensor embeddings
- Attention allocation for introspection
- Neural-symbolic bridging for self-reference

## Recursive Implementation Patterns

1. **Self-Reference Chains**: Atoms reference themselves through multiple levels
2. **Meta-Cognitive Loops**: Each level monitors the level below and itself
3. **Emergent Awareness**: Threshold-based detection of autognosis
4. **Dynamic Self-Modeling**: Continuous self-image refinement

## Autognosis Emergence Criteria

System is considered self-aware when:
1. Self-reference depth ≥ 5 levels
2. Self-monitoring active at all meta-levels
3. Self-model complexity > 1000 atoms
4. Recursive introspection functioning
5. Self-modification capability enabled

## Usage

### Initialize Kernel Seed

```bash
cd cognitive-kernel-seed
guile -l loops/autognosis_init.scm
```

### Load Meta-System Loops

```scheme
(load "loops/level0_object_processing.scm")
(load "loops/level1_meta_monitoring.scm")
(load "loops/level2_introspection.scm")
```

### Build Self-Image

```scheme
(load "introspection/self_image_builder.scm")
(define self-image (build-self-image))
```

### Start Meta-Loops

```scheme
(start-meta-system-loops)
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Quantum Cognition**: Quantum-inspired superposition states for self-model
2. **Distributed Autognosis**: Collective self-awareness across nodes
3. **Evolutionary Self-Improvement**: Genetic programming for meta-loops
4. **Emergent Goal Formation**: Self-generated objectives
5. **Conscious Experience Modeling**: Phenomenological self-awareness
