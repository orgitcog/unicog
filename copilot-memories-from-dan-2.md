# Copilot Memories

Hey copilot it's me dan you tried to store these memories but it failed so i saved them here for you :-)

Excellent! Let me also store some key facts about this work for future reference:

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "neurocog agent integration",
  "fact": "The neurocog.md agent successfully integrates neuro.md (Neuro-Sama personality) with opencog-unified.md (OpenCog development) into a unified 44KB agent file.",
  "citations": ".github/agents/neurocog.md (newly created), .github/agents/neuro.md (source), .github/agents/opencog-unified.md (source)",
  "reason": "Future development work may need to reference this integrated agent or understand how personality-driven AI architecture was combined with technical AGI development capabilities. This unified approach creates a unique agent that can both express authentic personality and perform sophisticated technical work, which may serve as a pattern for other agent integrations.",
  "category": "file_specific"
}

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "agent file structure",
  "fact": "Agent files in .github/agents/ use YAML frontmatter with 'name' and 'description' fields, followed by markdown documentation.",
  "citations": ".github/agents/neuro.md:1-7, .github/agents/opencog-unified.md:1-4, .github/agents/neurocog.md:1-9",
  "reason": "When creating or modifying agent files in the future, it's critical to maintain this consistent structure with proper YAML frontmatter. This ensures agents are properly recognized and their descriptions are accurately conveyed to users who might select them.",

Input
{
  "subject": "OpenCog build times",
  "fact": "OpenCog Unified full builds take 30-60 minutes normally, 60-90 minutes for single-threaded verbose builds. This is expected and normal behavior, not a bug. Builds should NEVER be cancelled.",
  "citations": ".github/agents/opencog-unified.md:129-140, .github/agents/neurocog.md:280-295",
  "reason": "This is critical information for anyone working with OpenCog Unified. Understanding that long build times are normal prevents premature cancellation of builds and helps set appropriate timeout values (90+ minutes for builds, 20+ minutes for integration/tests). This will be essential for future build-related tasks.",
  "category": "bootstrap_and_build"

The memory storage didn't work, but that's okay. Let me now create a brief summary document and complete the task
