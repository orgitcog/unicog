# Job Description: Cognitive Kernel Engineer

**Position:** Cognitive Kernel Engineer  
**Team:** CogOS Kernel Team  
**Location:** Remote  
**Project:** CogOS (Cognitive Operating System)

---

## About the Project

We are launching a revolutionary project to build **CogOS**, a pure Inferno kernel-based distributed AGI operating system. Our vision is to shift the paradigm from "AGI as an application" to "AGI as an operating system," where cognitive processes like thinking, reasoning, and learning are not layered on top of an existing OS but are fundamental kernel-level services. By integrating OpenCog's cognitive architectures directly into the Inferno kernel, we are creating a platform where intelligence emerges from the OS itself. This is a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of operating systems design and artificial general intelligence, contributing to a project that will redefine the future of AI.

## The Role

As a Cognitive Kernel Engineer, you will be a core member of the team responsible for building the heart of CogOS. You will design, implement, and optimize the kernel-level services that bring cognitive functions to life. You will work with a world-class team of OS developers and AI researchers to solve some of the most challenging problems in computer science, from kernel-level hypergraph management to distributed cognitive scheduling. This is not just another kernel development job; it is a chance to build the foundation of a thinking machine.

## Responsibilities

- Design and implement core kernel modules for CogOS in **C**, running on a forked **Inferno OS**.
- Port, adapt, and optimize OpenCog's core cognitive mechanisms, including the **AtomSpace** (hypergraph knowledge base) and the **Economic Attention Network (ECAN)**, into high-performance kernel services.
- Develop and implement a new set of **cognitive system calls** (e.g., `atom_create`, `attention_allocate`) to expose cognitive functions to user-space applications and agents.
- Implement and manage the **`/cog` namespace**, a virtual filesystem that represents all cognitive resources—atoms, agents, and thoughts—as files.
- Tackle complex challenges in kernel-level memory management, concurrency, and process scheduling to ensure the AtomSpace and other cognitive services are scalable, thread-safe, and performant.
- Profile and optimize kernel code to meet demanding performance targets, such as a 10,000+ atoms/second creation rate and sub-10ms attention allocation.
- Collaborate closely with the Cognitive Services and Distributed Systems teams to ensure seamless integration of kernel services with higher-level cognitive functions and distributed protocols.
- Contribute to the design and implementation of the overall CogOS architecture, ensuring it remains simple, orthogonal, and extensible.

## Required Qualifications

- Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related field.
- 5+ years of professional experience in systems programming, with a strong focus on **kernel development**.
- Expert-level proficiency in **C programming** and a deep understanding of low-level system internals.
- Proven experience with operating system architecture, including memory management, virtual filesystems, process scheduling, and concurrency control.
- A deep understanding of, or direct experience with, the architectural principles of **Inferno OS**, **Plan 9**, or similar microkernel or distributed operating systems.
- Strong familiarity with graph-based knowledge representation, with a specific understanding of or experience with hypergraph databases like **OpenCog's AtomSpace**.

## Preferred Qualifications

- Direct experience contributing to the **OpenCog** project, especially the **AtomSpace** or **ECAN** attention allocation system.
- Experience with the **Limbo programming language** and the **Dis virtual machine**.
- A strong background in distributed systems, including consensus algorithms, remote procedure calls, and distributed data synchronization.
- Familiarity with the theoretical foundations of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), cognitive architectures, or computational neuroscience.
- A portfolio of contributions to open-source operating systems or related low-level projects.
- Experience in performance analysis and optimization of kernel-level code.

## What We Offer

- A unique opportunity to work on a groundbreaking project that merges the fields of operating systems and artificial general intelligence.
- A deeply technical and research-oriented environment with a focus on innovation and engineering excellence.
- The chance to collaborate with leading experts in AI and systems programming.
- A competitive salary, comprehensive benefits, and a flexible remote work environment.
- The satisfaction of building a technology that could fundamentally change the world.
