# Entelechy Framework Documentation

This directory contains documentation on the Entelechy vital actualization framework - a system for tracking, managing, and resolving developmental markers in the cognitive architecture.

## What is Entelechy?

Entelechy (from Aristotelian philosophy) represents the actualization of potential. In the OpenCog Unified context, it's a framework for:
- Tracking developmental markers (TODO, FIXME, PLACEHOLDER)
- Managing fragmentation and coherence
- Orchestrating repair workflows
- Measuring actualization progress

## Contents

- **Implementation Guides**: How to use the Entelechy framework
- **Repair Workflows**: Systematic approaches to marker resolution
- **Fragmentation Analysis**: Detecting and resolving architectural fragmentation
- **Marker Management**: Tools and processes for marker lifecycle
- **Introspection Reports**: Deep analysis of system state

## Key Concepts

- **Markers**: Developmental indicators in the codebase
- **Fragmentation**: Architectural inconsistencies or incomplete integration
- **Actualization**: The process of realizing potential implementations
- **Repair**: Systematic resolution of markers and fragmentation
