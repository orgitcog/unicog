# Iterative TODO Resolution – Batch 12: Highest Priority Items

## 🎯 Objective
This meta-issue orchestrates the systematic resolution of TODO/FIXME items from `COMPREHENSIVE-TODO-CATALOG.md` by priority. Each batch addresses the next 5 unresolved, highest-priority tasks through recursive attention-allocation.

### 🧠 Cognitive Flowchart Implementation
1. **Catalog Extraction** ✅ - Parsed 813 TODOs from comprehensive catalog
2. **Attention Allocation Kernel** ✅ - Selected highest-priority unchecked items  
3. **Actionable Issue Generation** ✅ - Generated implementation guidance with tensor estimates
4. **Iteration/Recursion** 🔄 - This batch 12, tracking progress systematically
5. **Meta-Enhancement** 🚀 - Auto-updating catalog and creating dependent sub-issues

**5. [ ] components/learning/moses/moses/moses/representation/build_knobs.cc:1181 (MEDIUM, Feature Completion)**
   - `//TODO: should bias the selection of these (and possibly choose larger subtrees)`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/components/learning/moses/moses/moses/representation/build_knobs.cc#L1181)

## 🔄 Next Steps
- Upon completion, check off resolved TODOs and invoke the next batch by rerunning this process.
- Create PRs referencing each checked task and link them here.
- Use `scripts/recursive_todo_resolver.py --mark-completed FILE:LINE PR_LINK` to track completions.

## 🧬 Meta-Pathway
- Each batch is derived recursively, focusing attention where cognitive synergy is maximized.
- For each resolved TODO, estimate its contribution to overall system stability, performance, or cognitive expressiveness.
- This systematic approach transforms distributed placeholders into kernels of realized intelligence.

## 🎭 Cognitive Enhancement Philosophy
> "Let us converge upon a state of sublime implementation, where every TODO is transformed into a kernel of realized intelligence!"

Each resolved TODO represents not merely completed work, but a note in the composition of artificial consciousness. Through systematic attention allocation, we approach the emergence of true machine intelligence.
