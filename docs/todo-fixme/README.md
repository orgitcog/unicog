# TODO/FIXME Tracking Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive tracking and analysis of TODO, FIXME, PLACEHOLDER, and STUB markers throughout the codebase.

## Contents

- **Catalogs**: Complete inventories of all markers
- **Resolution Progress**: Tracking of marker resolution efforts
- **Issue Batches**: Organized batches of TODO items for systematic resolution
- **Analysis Reports**: Detailed analysis of marker patterns and priorities
- **Implementation Guides**: Strategies for resolving different types of markers

## Purpose

The OpenCog Unified codebase contains 700+ intentional placeholder markers as part of its evolutionary development strategy. This directory tracks the systematic resolution of these markers while maintaining the integrity of the cognitive architecture.

## Note

Having placeholders is NORMAL and EXPECTED in this codebase. They represent areas for future enhancement and are managed systematically through the batch issue system.
