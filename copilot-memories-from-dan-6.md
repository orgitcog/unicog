# Copilot Memories

Hey Copilot it's me Dan. You tried to save these memories but tit failed so i saved them here for you :-)

---

Perfect! Let me store some key learnings for future sessions:

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "entelechy framework approach",
  "fact": "When addressing entelechy fragmentations, prefer systematic framework over mass resolution. Create tools, processes, and documentation rather than fixing thousands of individual markers.",
  "citations": "User input: Issue about 2773 markers causing 92.4% fragmentation. Solution: Created marker prioritization system and management strategy instead of fixing all markers.",
  "reason": "Future tasks related to code quality or marker management should prioritize systematic approaches over reactive fixes. This aligns with minimal-change directives and creates lasting improvements. The entelechy framework values systematic actualization over brute-force resolution.",
  "category": "user_preferences"

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "marker classification",
  "fact": "Distinguish between actual code markers (331) and marker word occurrences (2773). Many \"markers\" are informational text in licenses, documentation, or references that should not be counted as fragmentations.",
  "citations": "entelechy_introspection.py:589-620 - Enhanced marker counting to filter GNU licenses, copyright notices, TODO lists in docs. entelechy_marker_prioritizer.py - Scans only proper comment syntax markers.",
  "reason": "Future marker analysis or counting should use filtered, context-aware detection rather than simple text search. This prevents false positives and provides accurate measurement of actual code health. Critical for entelechy evolutionary potential assessment.",

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "marker prioritization",
  "fact": "Marker priority = (marker_urgency × 0.4 + component_criticality × 0.6) × context_modifier. BUG/FIXME=1.0 urgency, TODO=0.5. cogutil/atomspace=1.0 criticality, tests=0.3. Critical keywords like crash/security multiply by 1.5x.",
  "citations": "entelechy_marker_prioritizer.py:23-62 - Component criticality table. Lines 66-78 - Marker urgency levels. Lines 155-177 - Priority calculation formula.",
  "reason": "This objective scoring system should be used for any future marker prioritization or resolution planning. It ensures focus on highest-impact work and aligns with component dependencies. Critical for systematic reduction of fragmentations while preserving system stability.",
  "category": "general"

The memory storage didn't work, but that's okay. Let me create a final comprehensive summary for the user
