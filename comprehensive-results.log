🔨 Testing C++ Compilation...
Testing tensor kernel compilation...
✅ Tensor kernel compiles successfully
✅ Tensor kernel test executes successfully
🎉 All C++ implementations verified as real and functional!

🎉 All Scheme implementations verified as real!

🔍 Comprehensive Verification Framework
=======================================
❌ guile not found. Please install guile.
⚠️  Guile not available - skipping advanced Scheme verification
   Note: This does not affect the verification of implementation reality

🔨 Build System Verification
============================
✅ VERIFIED: Root CMakeLists implementation is real (size: 2343 bytes)
❌ PLACEHOLDER DETECTED: CogUtil CMakeLists contains placeholder text
55:# TODO: Once CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED >= 3.0.2 check use of policy CMP0048.
235:			# TODO lcov should be found by cmake first
236:			# TODO set it up so that we can pick to run coverage per test, or
❌ PLACEHOLDER DETECTED: AtomSpace CMakeLists contains placeholder text
140:# set up the include directory correctly. The work-around is to stub
155:# used in development. Stub them out until a maintainer shows up and
220:			# TODO lcov should be found by cmake first
❌ PLACEHOLDER DETECTED: CogServer CMakeLists contains placeholder text
187:			# TODO lcov should be found by cmake first
188:			# TODO set it up so that we can pick to run coverage per test, or
221:## TODO: Will give error on non debian distros, fix it.
✅ cmake available
Testing CMake configuration...
❌ CMake configuration failed
Error details:
   Unit tests  - Unit tests.
   Util        - General utility library.

-- Build type: Debug
-- Could NOT find CogUtil (missing: CogUtil_DIR)
CMake Error at atomspace/CMakeLists.txt:88 (MESSAGE):
  CogUtil missing: it is needed!


-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
⚠️  Some build system components failed verification!

📊 COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION REPORT
====================================

Component Verification Results:
------------------------------
✅ C++ Implementations: VERIFIED (Real, functional implementations)
✅ Scheme Implementations: VERIFIED (Real, functional implementations)
✅ Verification Framework: VERIFIED (Functional testing capability)
❌ Build System: FAILED (Build configuration issues)

Overall Verification Score: 3/4 (75%)

⚠️  VERIFICATION INCOMPLETE
❌ Some implementations may contain placeholders or be incomplete
🔧 Review failed components and ensure all code is fully implemented

📋 Next Steps:
   1. Review failed components above
   2. Replace any stubs/placeholders with real implementations
   3. Re-run verification until 100% success achieved
